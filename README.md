# Roadmap

## Print total time recorded

- When printing records, there should be the total time recorded.

## Suggest old tickets

- Users should not need to type ticket description every time

## Sorting of records

- When printing the records, the order is "random"

## Support multiple days

- Currently, all records are in one file and
- When printing, all records are printed
- print only for current day
- select day to print?
- separate files files for each day?

## add field for ticket number?

- add optional field for aggresso nr?

# Ideas for future improvements

- Log what tickets I'm working on
- Log format: something human readable. CSV?
- Retroactively edit activities
- List logged activities. Per day, Per Week, Since Date?
- Bash/Zsh integration
- If somehow possible, insert activities into agresso
